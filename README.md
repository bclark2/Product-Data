# ProductData

Simple but powerful python program that allows you to use some pre-uploaded
images of barcodes for the purposes of getting product. This program uses
opencv and a few other packages and makes use of the barcodelookup.com API.
I found their service and I think thats it's a pretty intersting service. I used the
API to look for data for product data related to GPUs. You can find information regarding their trial
period here --> https://www.barcodelookup.com/api-documentation

Get yourself set up with an API key from barcodelookup, instal the packages, and get some clear images
of product barcodes and you should get back product information. 


Grab Images, look for barcodes, and query api for products details
